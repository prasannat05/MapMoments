MapMoments is a location-based micro-social platform aimed at college campuses. It offers an intuitive and visual way to stay connected to the ongoing events, alerts, and moments happening in specific campus zones without needing GPS or traditional profiles. Users interact with an interactive campus map and engage with short-lived updates (pings) tied to specific zones, such as the library, auditorium, and canteen.
